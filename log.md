# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--

### Day 6: August 5, 2020 <br>

**Day 6 Progress**: <br>
- Learned a little more about how to format text in this very log!

**Thoughts:** It's going to take a long time just to find my rhythm. I think I'm going to just try my best to focus on completing FCC's Responsive Web Certification and App Academy's Full Stack Prep Course. <br>
