# 100 Days Of Code - Log<br>

### Day 5: August 4, 2020 <br>

**Day 5 Progress**: <br>
- Discovered CodePen, thanks to this challenge.<br>
- Watched a few videos about code related things (which I am counting because sitting through a video is harder for me than working through code challenges).<br>
- FCC: Began *Applied Accessibility* and completed 8 challenges.

**Thoughts:** It's so hard in the beginning to find focus.<br>
